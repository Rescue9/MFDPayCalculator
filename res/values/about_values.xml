    <string name="about_description">This application is designed to calculate the base &amp; gross amounts that a member will receive on their paycheck. It takes into account the number of scheduled shift days, holidays, and any unscheduled overtime that an employee worked. It will calculate based upon the base pay, overtime 1, and overtime 2 values of a particular pay scale. Also factored in are longevity and state incentive based upon which pay period is selected before calculating.\n\nThe application now correctly calculates tax rate, and deductions (currently available in the premium version) that the individual may have.\n\nThe inspiration for creating this application came from an Excel spreadsheed that MFD Engineer Baldwin created.\n\nPlease submit any bugs to the email below.\n\nWhile this application is designed to update while preserving your preferences, understand that this is still a work in progress and changes in the preference structure may affect the way updated versions work. If you experience \'force closing\' of the application, please delete all data from the System Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;MFD Pay Calculator menu.</string><string name="release_version">Version - TESTING</string>
