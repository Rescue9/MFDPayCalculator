#MFD Pay Calculator for Android
#####Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Andrew Buskov.

This application is for memebers of the Madisonville Fire Department. It is a simple paycheck calculator. This  application will calculate the Base Pay and Gross Pay for a given pay date. It calculates holiday hours, longevity, and overtime rates 1 & 2.  

This application is designed specifically for the members of Madisonville Fire Department. There is currently no way for this application to apply to anyone else as the formulas are static. This may change in the future, but not until I finish tweaking this application for my department.

Also, this is as much a learning process for Git & Github & issues as it is learning Android & Java. MFD Pay Calculator is the first 'production' application I have developed. Previously I was limited to "Hello World".
