MFD Pay Calculator for Android

Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Andrew Buskov.

This application is designed specifically for the members of Madisonville Fire Department. There is currently no way for this application to apply to anyone else as the formulas are currently static. This may change in the future, but not until I have a bit more coding experience as this whole application is a learning process.
  
This  application is used to calculate the Base Pay and Gross Pay for a given pay date. It calculates holiday hours, and overtime rates 1 & 2.  
This is definitely still a work in progress.

Also. this is as much a learning process for Git & Github & issues as it is learning Android & Java.
