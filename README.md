#MFD Pay Calculator
#####Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Andrew Buskov.
------

This Android application is for memebers of the Madisonville Fire Department. It is a simple paycheck calculator. This  application will calculate the Base Pay, Gross Pay, Simple Taxes (in-progress), and Deposit amount for a given pay date. It calculates base-pay rate, holiday hours, longevity, and overtime rates 1 & 2.

This application is designed specifically for the members of Madisonville Fire Department. There is currently no way for this application to apply to anyone else as the formulas are static. This may change in the future, but not until I finish tweaking this application for my department.

Also, this is as much a learning process for git, Github & issues as it is learning Android & Java. MFD Pay Calculator is the first 'production' application I have developed. Previously I was limited to "Hello World".

Please direct all questions & comments to mobile.apps@corridor9.design.com. In addition, I respectfully request to be notified for all bugs or issues found via the email address versus negative feedback in the Play store. I would also appreciate any input on how to make my code cleaner, or additional features that could be added.

Current source code for this project can be found at my GitHub page (@Rescue9).
