<h5>Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Andrew Buskov.</h5>

<hr><p>This Android application is for memebers of the Madisonville
Fire Department. It is a simple paycheck calculator. This application
will calculate the Base Pay, Gross Pay, Simple Taxes (in-progress), and
Deposit amount for a given pay date. It calculates base-pay rate,
holiday hours, longevity, and overtime rates 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>This application is designed specifically for the members of
Madisonville Fire Department. There is currently no way for this
application to apply to anyone else as the formulas are static. This
may change in the future, but not until I finish tweaking this
application for my department.</p>

<p>Also, this is as much a learning process for git, Github &amp;
issues as it is learning Android &amp; Java. MFD Pay Calculator is the
first 'production' application I have developed. Previously I was
limited to "Hello World".</p>

<p>Please direct all questions &amp; comments to
mobile.apps@corridor9.design.com. In addition, I respectfully request
to be notified for all bugs or issues found via the email address
versus negative feedback in the Play store. I would also appreciate any
input on how to make my code cleaner, or additional features that could
be added.</p>

<p>Current source code for this project can be found at my GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/Rescue9" class="user-mention">@Rescue9</a>).</p>
